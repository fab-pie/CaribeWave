This project was made during a computer science workshop about tsunami and earthquake. We used plane api and we simulate data from sensor to get the sea lvl to make an online interface to get data in real time that might be usefull in emergency case. 
Next step waiting for material : using our radio antenna to get the plane location and information and put sea level sensor near Guadeloupe coast to have our data and without needing anything from others.
For now we have a local website that show us data from the fake sensor and the plane and to update it we have to run it again since we are limited with the api usage/months
